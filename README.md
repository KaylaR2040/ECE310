Example code used in lectures and other demos.

This repository holds starter code that will be used in class, and potentially for other demos, during the Spring 2025 semester. It is intended for use by ECE 309 students only, and the repository will become private after the semester is over.

Students in ECE 309 are allowed to copy and use this code freely, but are not allowed to create a public repository with this code. Some code is copyrighted by other sources (e.g., the textbook) and is reproduced here for educational purposes only. The copyright for such code may not be clearly noted. Code in this repository may not be used in other commercial or open-source projects; it may only be used for purposes related to ECE 309 during the Spring 2025 semester (Jan-May 2025).
